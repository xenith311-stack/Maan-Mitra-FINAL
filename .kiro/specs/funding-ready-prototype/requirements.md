# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of Mann-Mitra from a basic mental health app into a comprehensive, funding-ready prototype specifically designed for Indian youth (ages 16-30). The enhanced platform will demonstrate market viability through AI-based therapy delivered via diverse, engaging activities that are culturally-aware and AI-led.

The prototype will showcase a revolutionary approach to mental health care through AI-powered therapeutic activities including guided conversations, interactive exercises, personalized meditation sessions, cognitive behavioral therapy modules, and crisis intervention - all tailored to Indian cultural contexts and delivered in multiple languages. This activity-based therapeutic approach sets it apart from traditional Western mental health solutions by making therapy accessible, engaging, and culturally relevant.
